One programming technique that we would both like to incorperate over
the course of the semester would be better use of version control.
Specifically we would like to take better advantage of branches in
git. Since we where alternating between platforms and pushing to a
shared repo there where several points where this became confusing 
for a short period of time. One of us forgot to pull the latest
version of the code before making changes and this produced some
merge errors when it was caught. We have both used branches in the
past however the practice will be good too.

If we do this correctly it will also allow us to compartmentalize
different parts of the code creation. This way if a we find that
something we are trying to implement will not work it will be much
easier to revert back to a working version.
